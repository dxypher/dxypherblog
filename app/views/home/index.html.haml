    %p.section-title ABOUT ME
    %p After attending Code Academy in Chicago early in 2012 I moved to San Francisco where I joined a team of full stack Ruby on Rails developers at one of the leading startups in the online clothing consignment space. While working on the web team I helped build new features for the companies client facing app while continually adding to and sharpening my skills to bring more value to my team and company.

      Learning has always been one of my passions. From learning to fly airplanes at the age of 19 to persuing careers in finance and marketing, having a hunger for knowledge has been critical. That's why I enjoy developing so much, because the learning and problem solving never end. I'm currently looking for a new opportunity to join a team of developers who value learning, growth and enjoy sharing knowledge amongst one another. If your team has room for a developer like me, please don't hesitate to
