Hello,

This is my personal website and blog. It's built with Ruby on Rails using HAML, SASS, and JS on the front end.

This site is located at www.dxypher.com and is currently deployed to AWS EC2. I use Elastic Beanstalk for deployment and AWS's RDS service for my database. I also use AWS's Route 53 for my DNS.

The site is still a work in progress.
